7419,@@23830603,vulnerable,in,"Dr Mayengbam Lalit Singh Recently honourable PM of India launched scheme called `` Doubling Farmers ' Income `` in order to uplift the welfare being of larger portion of Indians . The big question felt by people are ( i ) How would it be possible in short period of time ? And ( ii ) is it an elusive doctrine to sweep vote bank of million of farmer for upcoming parliamentary election in 2019 ? Across all over India ( except for a few state ) so many rigidity have to be solved in order to raise the real income of farmer . These rigidity are characterised by infrastructure , structure and institution . The present article focus on those rigidity only for Manipur which ha been lagging behind many Indian state . Regarding infrastructure ( input ) , the state is found backward among those backward state of India . Introspecting water infrastructure , the state ha been under-utilising water resource despite the abundant availability . For Kharif season crop farmer rely on rain water since the state is under the map of SE monsoon . However , during Rabi and Zayed season the state ha been witnessing scarcity of water . In order to curb this shortage , government need construction of multiple check dam and digging bore well in those small stream flowing across the plain area . During peak season , there is always a shortage of manure and pesticide due to landslide on national highway . Revolution of organic farming will lessen dependency on chemical fertiliser since the state ha high potential of producing organic manure and pesticide . During post harvesting period , the state need to construct cold storage so that perishable crop can be stored for agricultural off season . Regarding financial support to farming , bank are not integrated with farmer . Moreover state government doe not organise crop insurance scheme in order to compensate the loss due to natural calamity . My previous article on `` Channelizing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ) with Crop and Livestock Insurances in India `` postulate the model on how to compensate the loss . The second rigid character of farming is that there had been no structural change over decade . Farming in Manipur focus on production of only coarse cereal which is characterised by immediate consumption . In this era of globalisation farming should have close introspection of demand and supply model of consumer across the world . Especially in hilly area , cultivation of coarse cereal is just to meet local consumption and not for earning profit . Nowadays , farmer stated cultivation of illegal crop such a poppy illegally in order to earn huge profit . In order to prevent this , government should emphasise on cultivation cash crop such yongchak ( parkia speciosa ) , cardamom , tea , coffee , black pepper , etc . since these crop are highly demanded in international a well a domestic market . On the other hand this can reduce environmental destruction which is followed after short period zoom cultivation . In plain area also main crop are also coarse cereal which are vulnerable to low profit . Farmers should diversify in cultivation of cash crop such a black rice , medicinal plant , oil seed , mushroom , etc . Moreover farmer should engage themselves in nonfarm sector wherein both farm and nonfarm sector can be fitted in supply and demand schedule for their input and output . One of the institutional rigidity faced by the farmer is asymmetric information on the technological development in agricultural sector . Krishi Vigyan Kendras ( KVKs ) had been instituted in every district across India in order to fill the information gap between farmer and agricultural scientist . However their work had been found confined to laboratory only and their expertise are hardly in the knowledge domain of farmer . Government should frame policy for KVKs so that they should be available to farmer at least once in a week on alternative block . Another institutional rigidity we witness is financial inaccessibility of farmer to existing financial institution ( bank ) . In India , bank are found to release fund to manufacturing and service sector but not on agricultural sector . Too much official procedure and rigid financial security create inaccessibility of farmer to bank . So the bank should be advised to make survey on the constructive environment wherein farmer should accede and return loan in time . Another important institutional rigidity is lack of marketing institution such a marketing farm and agent which can deal in such agricultural product . Government should invite both local and nonlocal farm which can link farmer with consumer at price determined by market rate . Government also should have policy such a Minimum Support Price and construction of Cold Storages so that various type of agricultural product can be available during their offseason . The last most important institutional rigidity is inability of government to constitute an integral body which comprises above mentioned farmer body , financial institute , KVKs , Marketing farm and government funded research institute . If the integral body function with mutual exchange of working with all institutional constituent , dream of `` Doubling Farmers ' Income `` can be achieved . Let this article may draw attention of Agricultural Ministry in fulfilling it ambition .",0,0,5493

However , more remains to be done . Without compromising on access to school , the focus should be on improving the quality . The education budget allocation is now 3.02 % of GDP , up from 2.83 % last year but is still short of the target . The down side of the situation is that 19 % child aged 6-16 still remain out of school . The remaining 81 % that are enrolled in the 6-16 age bracket are not learning much either . The seventh ASER survey report also highlighted a per past trend that child enrolled in private school are performing better compared to those studying in government school . The number of child out of school should be a cause for concern for the entire nation and especially the Federal and the Provincial government . It is quite obvious that poverty is the main cause that keep child away from school and force them to do some work to help supplement income of their family . The problem can be addressed to a great extent if number of government school is increased meaningfully . Government school charge little or no fee but these are not enough to cater to the need of growing population . The distance factor and involvement of unbearable travelling expense also prohibit parent from sending their child to school . Private school have mushroomed both in urban and rural area and they are catering to the need of middle and high income segment of the society but poor family can not afford to get their kid admitted in these school . Their owner should also realise they have social and national obligation a well and offer some percentage of total admission to student from poorest of the poor family free of cost .
